Hi! Thanks for stopping by my GitHub page to check out my performance task files!

- Open the HTML file in a browser to get a more interactive experience
- Use the PDF file to print 
- Use the .ipynb file to open a Jupyter Notebook
- The prep.md file gives you a glimpse into my thought processes in preparing for this task
- The data directory holds all of the data files used
- The sandbox file contains a few Jupyter notebooks where I was getting my bearings
